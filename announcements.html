          <p>In order to maintain a balanced and informative environment, we have established advertising guidelines. Org-related 
          events may be posted once a day, discouraging excessive reposting. Members who repeatedly violate this rule will be sanctioned with 
          a warning, followed by removal from the group for subsequent offenses. However, exceptions will be made for enrollment schedules, 
          emergency announcements, and other special cases. Additionally, advertising anything unrelated to DLSU is strictly prohibited without
          prior permission from the admins. We do, however, allow advertising of academic-related matters such as Market2 and Markeve, 
          provided we are informed in advance. The selling of graphing kits or any academic items is also allowed within the group's scope.</p>
